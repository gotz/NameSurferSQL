NameSurferSQL is a modified version of my CS242 project.

Some improvements:
SQLite based: instead of reading in a file every time the program starts,
    it query's the database
Multi-name capable: the user is able to enter up to 4 names and it will display
    all of the rankings.  Why 4?  Any more and it gets too complicated/jumbled.


Cool Features:
 - Able to use SQLite's wildcard operator (%)


Future Plans:
 [ ] - Close SQLite queries
 [ ] - Use the wildcard operator to get the first 4 matches.
 [ ] - Move the name/color guide off the graph and to jLabels in the bottom panel
